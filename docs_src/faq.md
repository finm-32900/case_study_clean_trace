## Getting Started

### Do I need a WRDS subscription?
Yes, the pipeline requires WRDS access with TRACE Enhanced, Standard, or 144A entitlements, plus FISD and ratings data for Stage 1. You can check your entitlements by logging into WRDS and viewing your subscriptions.

### Can I run this on my local machine?
Both Stage 0 and Stage 1 are designed for WRDS Cloud due to database access requirements, though technically they can run locally with proper WRDS connectivity. WRDS Cloud is recommended for optimal performance.

### How long does processing take?
Using `./run_pipeline.sh` (complete automated pipeline):
- **Pre-stage (data downloads)**: ~5 minutes
- **Stage 0 (Enhanced TRACE)**: ~4 hours
- **Stage 0 (Standard TRACE)**: ~30-60 minutes
- **Stage 0 (Rule 144A)**: ~30-60 minutes
- **Stage 0 (Report generation)**: ~30-60 minutes
- **Stage 1 (Bond analytics)**: ~2 hours
- **Total**: ~7 hours for complete pipeline

### What if I only want Enhanced TRACE?
You can customize which datasets to process in `config.py` (applies to all stages):
```python
TRACE_MEMBERS = ["enhanced"]  # Process only Enhanced TRACE
```

Or run Stage 0 jobs individually:
```bash
qsub stage0/run_enhanced_trace.sh    # Enhanced only
qsub stage0/run_standard_trace.sh    # Standard only
qsub stage0/run_144a_trace.sh        # 144A only
```

### What Python version do I need?
Python 3.10 or higher is required. Check your version:
```bash
python --version
```

### Do I need to install anything besides Python packages?
For Stage 0, you need:
- WRDS subscription with TRACE access
- SSH access to WRDS Cloud
- `.pgpass` file configured for password-less authentication
- Required Python packages (installed via `requirements.txt`)

---

## Configuration

### Where do I configure settings?
Settings are organized hierarchically:

1. **Shared settings** (`config.py` in root):
   - `WRDS_USERNAME`: Your WRDS username
   - `OUTPUT_FORMAT`: Output file format (parquet/csv)
   - `AUTHOR`: Your name
   - `TRACE_MEMBERS`: Which datasets to process (enhanced, standard, 144a) - **shared across all stages**
   - `STAGE0_OUTPUT_FIGURES`: Control Stage 0 error plot generation (can be slow)

2. **Stage 0 settings** (`stage0/_trace_settings.py`):
   - Filter switches, FISD parameters, chunk sizes
   - Decimal-shift and bounce-back parameters

3. **Stage 1 settings** (`stage1/_stage1_settings.py`):
   - Date cutoffs, performance tuning (cores, chunks)
   - Ultra-distressed filter configuration
   - **Note:** Stage 1 always generates reports and figures (no toggle)

### Do I need to configure anything to get started?
**Minimal configuration:** Just set your WRDS username in `config.py`:
```python
WRDS_USERNAME = os.getenv("WRDS_USERNAME", "your_wrds_id")
```

Most other settings are **auto-detected**:
- ✅ `ROOT_PATH`: Auto-detected from working directory
- ✅ `STAGE0_DATE_STAMP`: Auto-detected from Stage 0 output files
- ✅ `N_CORES`: Auto-detected from available CPUs

### How do I change the date range?

**Stage 0:** Edit `stage0/_trace_settings.py` and modify `PER_DATASET`:
```python
PER_DATASET = {
    "enhanced": dict(),  # Uses default full sample (2002-07-01 to present)
    "standard": dict(start_date="2023-01-01", data_type="standard"),
    "144a": dict(start_date="2023-01-01", data_type="144a"),
}
```

**Stage 1:** Edit `stage1/_stage1_settings.py`:
```python
DATE_CUT_OFF = "2023-12-31"  # Only include data through this date
```

### How do I adjust memory usage?
If you encounter memory errors, reduce `chunk_size` in `stage0/_trace_settings.py`:

```python
COMMON_KWARGS = {
    chunk_size = 150,  # Reduce from default 250
}
```

Or request more memory in job scripts (`stage0/run_enhanced_trace.sh`, etc.):
```bash
#$ -l m_mem_free=16G  # Increase from default
```

### Can I disable certain filters?
Yes! Edit `FILTER_SWITCHES` in `stage0/_trace_settings.py`:

```python
FILTER_SWITCHES = dict(
    dick_nielsen            = True,
    decimal_shift_corrector = True,
    bounce_back_filter      = False,  # Disable this filter
    # ... etc
)
```

### How do I change which bonds are included?
Modify `FISD_PARAMS` in `stage0/_trace_settings.py`:

```python
FISD_PARAMS = {
    "currency_usd_only": True,      # Only USD bonds
    "fixed_rate_only": True,        # Only fixed-rate bonds
    "tenor_min_years": 1.0,         # Minimum tenor
    # ... etc
}
```

### Can I change the output format from Parquet to CSV?
Yes! Edit `config.py` (applies to all stages):
```python
OUTPUT_FORMAT = "csv"  # Or "parquet" (recommended)
```

### How do I control Stage 0 error plot generation?
Stage 0 error plots are **very slow** to generate (30+ minutes for Enhanced TRACE). Control this in `config.py`:
```python
STAGE0_OUTPUT_FIGURES = False  # Skip error plots (tables only - faster)
STAGE0_OUTPUT_FIGURES = True   # Generate error plots (slow but comprehensive)
```

**Note:** Stage 1 always generates reports and figures regardless of this setting (essential for data quality).

### How do I change which datasets to process across all stages?
Edit `TRACE_MEMBERS` in `config.py` once, and it applies to all stages:
```python
TRACE_MEMBERS = ["enhanced"]                       # Enhanced only
TRACE_MEMBERS = ["enhanced", "standard"]           # Two datasets
TRACE_MEMBERS = ["enhanced", "standard", "144a"]  # All three (default)
```

---

## Output Files

### What format are the output files?
Output files are in **Parquet format** by default (compressed, efficient). Parquet is a columnar storage format that:
- Compresses well (~5-10x smaller than CSV)
- Loads faster
- Preserves data types
- Works with pandas, R, and many other tools

### How do I read the output files?
Using Python/pandas:
```python
import pandas as pd

# Read a single dataset
df = pd.read_parquet('enhanced/enhanced_20250120.parquet')

# Read multiple files
import glob
files = glob.glob('enhanced/*.parquet')
df = pd.concat([pd.read_parquet(f) for f in files], ignore_index=True)
```

Using R:
```r
library(arrow)
df <- read_parquet('enhanced/enhanced_20250120.parquet')
```

### What columns are in the output files?
All datasets (Enhanced, Standard, 144A) have the same column structure:

**Identifiers**:
- `cusip_id`: 9-character CUSIP identifier
- `trd_exctn_dt`: Trade execution date

**Price metrics**:
- `prc_ew`: Equal-weighted price
- `prc_vw`: Volume-weighted price (dollar)
- `prc_vw_par`: Volume-weighted price (par)
- `prc_first`: First trade price of day
- `prc_last`: Last trade price of day
- `prc_lo`: Low price of the day
- `prc_hi`: High price of the day

**Volume metrics** (in millions):
- `qvolume`: Par volume
- `dvolume`: Dollar volume

**Bid/Ask metrics**:
- `prc_bid`: Customer-side bid (value-weighted)
- `prc_ask`: Customer-side ask (value-weighted)

**Count metrics**:
- `trade_count`: Number of trades
- `bid_count`: Number of customer buys
- `ask_count`: Number of customer sells

### What do the audit files contain?
Audit files track row counts at each filter stage:
- `dick_nielsen_filters_audit_*.parquet`: Dick-Nielsen filter effects
- `drr_filters_audit_*.parquet`: Decimal-shift and bounce-back filter effects
- `fisd_filters_*.parquet`: FISD universe construction audit

These help you understand how many transactions were removed at each cleaning step.

### What are the CUSIP list files?
These files identify bonds that were corrected:
- `decimal_shift_cusips_*.parquet`: CUSIPs with decimal-shift corrections
- `bounce_back_cusips_*.parquet`: CUSIPs with bounce-back flags

Useful for understanding which bonds had price errors.

### What is the ultra_distressed_cusips CSV file? (Stage 1)
Stage 1 exports `stage1/data/ultra_distressed_cusips_{date}.csv` which contains all bonds flagged by the ultra-distressed filter. Each row shows:

**Columns**:
- `cusip_id`: Bond identifier
- `total_observations`: Total trades for this CUSIP
- `flagged_observations`: Number of flagged trades
- `pct_flagged`: Percentage flagged (%)
- `flag_anomalous_price`: Count of anomalous price flags
- `flag_upward_spike`: Count of upward spike flags
- `flag_plateau_sequence`: Count of plateau sequence flags
- `flag_intraday_inconsistent`: Count of intraday inconsistent flags
- `first_trade_date`: Earliest trade date
- `last_trade_date`: Latest trade date

**Use cases**:
- Identify problematic bonds for manual review
- Cross-reference with other bond characteristics (ratings, maturity, etc.)
- Understand filtering patterns across bond universe
- Quality control and diagnostics

### Where are the reports saved?
Reports are saved in `data_reports/[enhanced|standard|144a]/` with:
- LaTeX source file (`.tex`)
- Bibliography file (`references.bib`)
- Figures (`.pdf` files)

You can compile the LaTeX to PDF or view the figures directly.

### How do I download files from WRDS Cloud?

The pipeline generates a large folder (~6 GB) with hundreds of files. **Zip the folder first** for faster, more reliable downloads.

**Step 1: Create zip file on WRDS (via SSH)**

```bash
# Connect to WRDS
ssh {wrds_username}@wrds-cloud.wharton.upenn.edu

# Zip to scratch space (your home directory has limited quota)
cd /scratch/{institution}/
zip -r trace-data-pipeline.zip ~/trace-data-pipeline/
```

**Step 2: Download the zip file (from your LOCAL machine)**

**Windows (PowerShell/Terminal):**
```powershell
scp {wrds_username}@wrds-cloud.wharton.upenn.edu:/scratch/{institution}/trace-data-pipeline.zip "{local_destination}"
```

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
scp {wrds_username}@wrds-cloud.wharton.upenn.edu:/scratch/{institution}/trace-data-pipeline.zip "{local_destination}"
```

**Windows (WinSCP - GUI alternative):**
1. Connect to `wrds-cloud.wharton.upenn.edu`
2. Navigate to `/scratch/{institution}/`
3. Download `trace-data-pipeline.zip`

**Step 3: Extract locally**
- **Windows**: Right-click → Extract All
- **Mac**: Double-click the zip file
- **Linux**: `unzip trace-data-pipeline.zip`

**Step 4: Clean up (optional)**
```bash
# On WRDS Cloud
rm /scratch/{institution}/trace-data-pipeline.zip
```

**Placeholders:**
- `{wrds_username}`: Your WRDS username
- `{institution}`: Your institution's scratch folder (e.g., `wharton`, `chicago`, `nyu`)
- `{local_destination}`: Path on your local machine (e.g., `~/Downloads` or `C:\Users\YourName\Downloads`)

For detailed instructions, see [Quick Start Guide](quickstart.md#download-results-to-your-local-machine).

## Troubleshooting

### My job keeps failing with memory errors
**Solutions**:
1. Reduce `chunk_size` in `_trace_settings.py` (try 100 or 150)
2. Request more memory in shell scripts by adding:
   ```bash
   #$ -l m_mem_free=16G
   ```

### I'm getting "Permission denied" errors
**Solution**: Make scripts executable:
```bash
chmod +x run_all_trace.sh run_enhanced_trace.sh run_standard_trace.sh run_144a_trace.sh
```

### I'm getting "bad interpreter" or `^M` errors
**Solution**: Convert Windows line endings to Unix:
```bash
sed -i 's/\r$//' run_all_trace.sh
# Or fix all shell scripts:
find . -name "*.sh" -exec sed -i 's/\r$//' {} \;
```

### My job is stuck in queue (status 'qw')
**Possible causes**:
- WRDS resource constraints during peak hours
- Queue is full
- Requested resources not available

**Check status**:
```bash
qstat          # View all your jobs
qstat -j <job_id>  # View specific job details
```

### No data is being returned
**Check**:
1. Verify date ranges in `_trace_settings.py`
2. Confirm WRDS entitlements (Enhanced/Standard/144A)
3. Review logs for SQL errors: `cat logs/01_enhanced.err`
4. Ensure FISD filters aren't too restrictive

### Empty output files
**Check**:
1. Date ranges are correct
2. FISD filters aren't excluding all bonds
3. Review audit files to see where rows were dropped

### ImportError: No module named 'wrds' (or other package)
**Solution**: Install missing packages:
```bash
pip install --user wrds pandas numpy pandas-market-calendars
# Or install all requirements:
python -m pip install --user -r requirements.txt
```

### The report generation job (build_reports) never starts
**Explanation**: This is normal! When using `./run_all_trace.sh`, the report job shows status `hqw` (holding) until all three data jobs complete. It will automatically start when ready.

**Check progress**:
```bash
qstat  # Look for 'hqw' status - this means it's waiting for dependencies
```

### LaTeX compilation errors in reports
**Possible issues**:
- Missing figure files
- Missing `references.bib`
- Incomplete LaTeX installation

**Solution**: Ensure all figure files generated before compiling, or set `STAGE0_OUTPUT_FIGURES = False` in `config.py`.

### The pipeline shows a disk space warning - what should I do?
Before running the pipeline, it checks your WRDS quota. You'll see one of these:

**Sufficient space (>= 4 GB):**
```bash
=== DISK SPACE CHECK ===
[info] WRDS Quota - Home directory: 3.2 GB used / 10 GB limit
[info] Available space: 6.8 GB
[ok] Sufficient disk space available (6.8 GB >= 4.0 GB)
```
✅ **Proceed normally** - you have enough space.

**Insufficient space (< 4 GB):**
```bash
=== DISK SPACE CHECK ===
[info] WRDS Quota - Home directory: 7.88 GB used / 10 GB limit
[info] Available space: 2.12 GB
╔════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║                         ⚠️  WARNING  ⚠️                       ║
║  INSUFFICIENT DISK SPACE DETECTED                              ║
║  Available: 2.12 GB                                            ║
║  Required:  At least 4.0 GB recommended                        ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
[error] Exiting due to insufficient disk space.
```
⚠️ **Action required:**

**Option 1: Free up space (recommended)**
```bash
# Check what's using space
du -h ~/ | sort -h | tail -20

# Remove old files/logs
rm -rf ~/old_data/
rm -f ~/stage0/logs/*.log  # Old log files
rm -f ~/stage1/logs/*.log
```

**Option 2: Override warning (advanced users only)**
```bash
# Only if you're confident the pipeline won't exceed available space
FORCE_RUN=1 ./run_pipeline.sh
```

**Why this matters:** The pipeline generates large intermediate files. Running out of disk space mid-processing can corrupt output files or cause job failures.

### How do I check my WRDS disk quota?
```bash
quota  # Shows Home and Scratch directory usage/limits
```

Example output:
```
DIRECTORY  USED / LIMIT
    Home:  7.88GB / 10GB
 Scratch:  0B / 500GB
```

**Home directory** is where your project lives (10 GB limit on most WRDS accounts).
**Scratch directory** is shared storage (500 GB limit, shared with institution).

## Performance

### How can I make processing faster?
**Options**:

1. **Increase chunk size** (if you have enough memory):
   ```python
   COMMON_KWARGS = {
       chunk_size = 400,
       ...
   }
   ```

2. **Disable Stage 0 error plot generation** (saves 30-60 minutes):
   - Set `STAGE0_OUTPUT_FIGURES = False` in `config.py`

3. **Memory optimizations (automatic)**:
   - CUSIP columns use category dtype (~75% memory savings)
   - Optimized groupby operations for large datasets
   - Efficient parquet compression

### Can I run multiple datasets simultaneously?
Yes! That's exactly what `./run_all_trace.sh` does. It submits Enhanced, Standard, and 144A as parallel jobs.

```bash
qsub stage1/run_stage1.sh
```

### What about Stage 2?
Stage 2 is **in development** and will produce monthly panels with:
- 50+ bond characteristic signals
- Credit risk factors
- Liquidity measures
- Momentum and reversal signals
- Portfolio-ready outputs

**Expected release:** Coming soon
